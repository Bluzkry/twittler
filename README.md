#twittler
This is simple Twitter clone (front-end only, alas). Twittler imitates a real-life Twitter timeline, with randomly composed messages by four friends of the user.

One can also Tweet and see one's Tweets on the timeline.

**How to start Tweeting:**

1. Clone the project.

2. Double-click `index.html` to run the file.

3. Start Tweeting!
